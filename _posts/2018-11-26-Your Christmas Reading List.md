It’s almost December and that means the holidays are close. One of the things I absolutely love about holidays is that I have more time to do things I love like reading, catching up with friends and play video games. While playing video games is fun I tend to spend more time reading books. Here are ten books you should read during the holiday:

1. [The Lonely City by Olivia Laing](https://www.amazon.com/Lonely-City-Adventures-Being-Alone/dp/1250118034/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1543244469&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=the+lonely+city&psc=1): I found this book fascinating.
