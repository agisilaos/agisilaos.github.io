National November Novel Writing Month starts today. I'm so excited because I'm going to participate. For this month, I'm planning to write, edit, and publish ten pieces on my blog. I will use this twitter thread to keep myself accountable.

The theme of the pieces isn't going to be the same. I plan to write about a couple of different things I'm thinking about for a while now.

Why I'm doing this?

First of all, I love writing, and I want to become a better writer. There is no better way to do it than to do the work. Sometimes it's going to be hard; sentences aren't going to be as clear as I want, or I'm going to be stuck. And that's ok.

I want to participate in NaNoWriMo because I'm going to face all of these problems. I'm looking forward to becoming more familiar with the feeling of not good enough in terms of writing.

NaNoWriMo is a great way to meet other writers, share your learnings, discuss ideas, and have fun! Last but not least, I love to challenge myself, and this is a challenge.

Meanwhile, I already started working on my first piece, and I can't wait to publish it soon. I hope you have a great month ahead of you and keep writing. ✍️
